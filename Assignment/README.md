## Assignment: Exploratory Data Analysis

### Description:
This assigment creates 4 graphics for the : Individual household electric power consumption Data Set from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. See readme file from main ExData_Plotting1 repository.


### Files listed on this assignment:
- README.md - this file
- readPlotData.R - read data file and subsets data to Feb 1 and Feb 2 of 2007.
- Plot1.R - creates histogram of Global Active Power versus Frequency
- Plot2.R - creates line graph of Date and Time versus Global Active Power.
- Plot3.R - creates graph of Date and Time versus Energy sub metering variables (3)
- Plot4.R - creates 4 graphs of the 3 previous graphs plus a graph of Date and Time versus Voltage
- run_all.R - main script that executes all R scripts.
- plot1.png - graph created from Plot1.R
- plot2.png - graph created from Plot2.R
- plot3.png - graph created from Plot3.R
- plot4.png - graph created from Plot4.R


### How to generated all the graphs:

- a.From Github download the R files Electric power comsuption fiel for the [Exploratory Data Analysis] (https://github.com/rbonifac/ExData_Plotting1/tree/master/Assignment)
- b.Copy the R files to a directory called Assignment.
- b.Download raw data from source web link for [Raw Data] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip)
- c.Create a folder called data and Extract compressed file into the "data" folder.
- e.Double click on the run_all.R file and will automatically opens in the R console. Type source('run_all.R') to execute the script.
- f.Verify that the 4 png files have been created in the Assignment folder.
